Get me to the water arcade game.
=================================

To run game, please, fire up index.html in browser.

Use keys "up", "left", "right", "down" to control player.
Player starts with 3 lifes. Lives reduced when player meets BUG.
If player managed to reach water a new life is added as well as a new BUG.
When player lives count down to 0, game is restarted.

Have a fun!
